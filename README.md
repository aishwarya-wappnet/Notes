# Notes

 Static Typing: TypeScript introduces static typing to JavaScript. This means that you can specify the types of variables, function parameters, and return values. This helps catch type-related errors during development, providing better code quality and reliability.
Enhanced Code Readability: Explicitly declared types make the code more self-documenting. Developers can understand the purpose and usage of variables and functions without having to trace through the entire codebase.

When developing a software for a banking system, the choice between JavaScript (JS) and TypeScript (TS) depends on various factors including the size and complexity of the project, the team's familiarity with the languages, and the specific requirements of the banking system

Static Typing: TypeScript provides static typing, which helps catch type-related errors early in development. In a banking system, where accuracy and reliability are crucial, this can be a significant advantage.

Code Readability and Documentation: TypeScript code tends to be more self-documenting due to explicit type annotations. This can make it easier for developers to understand and maintain the codebase.

Improved Collaboration: TypeScript can make it easier for multiple developers to work on the same codebase, reducing the likelihood of type-related miscommunications.

Given the critical nature of a banking system, and the need for accuracy, security, and maintainability, using TypeScript with React is highly recommended.
